== Sonar ==

If you want to use sonar you will need to set the property "sonar.host.url" and
either the environment variable or the system property "runSonar" to true.

By default the postgres jdbc driver is available in the builder global project. If
you need other database drivers you will need to place them in the
"global/lib/sonar" directory. The ant task will load all jars in that directory for
the sonar task.
